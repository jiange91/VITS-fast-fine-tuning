./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_0.wav|Gary|[EN]So don't call me at 2 a.m., please.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_1.wav|Gary|[EN]And that's what makes the reds all together, because those all correspond to the same digit.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_2.wav|Gary|[EN]And now it generalizes deeper layers.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_3.wav|Gary|[EN]And it's actually log r theta.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_4.wav|Gary|[EN]Over here is when we go from writing the result to asking for the next input.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_5.wav|Gary|[EN]sample from that, feed that back in, et cetera.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_6.wav|Gary|[EN]since I rarely get this far in the class by this time.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_7.wav|Gary|[EN]And so blood rushes to the spot and you can tell where things were active.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_8.wav|Gary|[EN]But once you've changed your weights, I'm now in a new place on the air surface and I'm changing my weights from there.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_9.wav|Gary|[EN]I'm going to switch now.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_10.wav|Gary|[EN]Can I answer his question first, and then I'll answer your question?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_11.wav|Gary|[EN]And you find out the value from the verb tower in the encoder.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_12.wav|Gary|[EN]So they're really the same model, but they're getting two different inputs.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_13.wav|Gary|[EN]So you take some layer of the network and you apply BatchNorm to that.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_14.wav|Gary|[EN]And it turns out these fully connected layers, which take up huge amounts of memory, aren't that important.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_15.wav|Gary|[EN]You couldn't get it to work for the second question?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_16.wav|Gary|[EN]And then, so if we had more dimensions, we could easily get a linearly separable representation.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_17.wav|Gary|[EN]And so each, let me move my mouse.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_18.wav|Gary|[EN]And its job is to reproduce the image.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_19.wav|Gary|[EN]And now I'm plotting those numbers.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_20.wav|Gary|[EN]What's happening from left to right is they're being translated up and down from probably the middle picture.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_21.wav|Gary|[EN]and this is again part of league play.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_22.wav|Gary|[EN]Never spent that long on it before.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_23.wav|Gary|[EN]Is this clear to everyone what's going on here?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_24.wav|Gary|[EN]So if you have a rectified linear function like this, the slope is either 1 or 0.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_25.wav|Gary|[EN]At the end, I'm going to go over the midterm that I posted on Piazza yesterday or day before, whenever it was.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_26.wav|Gary|[EN]We're trying to model that underlying deterministic function with our network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_27.wav|Gary|[EN]And so those are various ways to augment the data.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_28.wav|Gary|[EN]That's Hal White, who was in the economics department here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_29.wav|Gary|[EN]But X's are given to you by God in the training set.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_30.wav|Gary|[EN]And so if we're doing average pooling, that's like having equal weights on all four. 0.25, 0.25, 0.25.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_31.wav|Gary|[EN]Here's one that takes in a sequence of inputs and produces one output at the end.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_32.wav|Gary|[EN]So we have local receptive fields, and we replicate them across the image. That gives us convolutions.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_33.wav|Gary|[EN]So that can't be right. Because they have the same size input and output layers.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_34.wav|Gary|[EN]So there are some efforts to reduce this.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_35.wav|Gary|[EN]And so, and also learning frame by frame, you're not learning any temporal dynamics.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_36.wav|Gary|[EN]Autoencoders are neural networks that take an input and try and reproduce that input on its output.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_37.wav|Gary|[EN]You average over all of those.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_38.wav|Gary|[EN]and then league exploiters that play everybody.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_39.wav|Gary|[EN]Okay, that's fine.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_40.wav|Gary|[EN]And it's going to be in a particular location in the input.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_41.wav|Gary|[EN]So I'm going to give you the simplest possible form of reinforcement learning.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_42.wav|Gary|[EN]That's something I haven't told you how to compute.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_43.wav|Gary|[EN]So you could have little filters and bigger filters and bigger filters.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_44.wav|Gary|[EN]And so it had the board as input.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_45.wav|Gary|[EN]So up here is where the character is going to come out.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_46.wav|Gary|[EN]She looks kind of OK this way, but whoops, not so OK.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_47.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, this should look familiar to those of you doing coding theory in ECE.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_48.wav|Gary|[EN]They have multiple attention heads, and they basically have a KQV attention mechanism.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_49.wav|Gary|[EN]E is 1, 1, 1 for this case.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_50.wav|Gary|[EN]and that'll generalize to new faces.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_51.wav|Gary|[EN]So it never really quite gets to zero or one.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_52.wav|Gary|[EN]and I use the rest of the mini-batches negative examples.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_53.wav|Gary|[EN]All of these should map to the same representation.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_54.wav|Gary|[EN]I mean, if it ends up being that way, it ends up being that way.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_55.wav|Gary|[EN]So my former high school intern, Brendan Lake, who's now a faculty at NYU, that's how old I am.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_56.wav|Gary|[EN]But it gave us these kind of global, weird-looking receptive fields of the units.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_57.wav|Gary|[EN]And then we have the height number coming in, and there's this weight.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_58.wav|Gary|[EN]So the key question for us is whether we want to start a global AI arms race or prevent it from starting.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_59.wav|Gary|[EN]for a quadratic like this.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_60.wav|Gary|[EN]and some early approaches that were in the bottom of that graph before.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_61.wav|Gary|[EN]Heon had been telling the computer vision people for years that they were going to learn their features.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_62.wav|Gary|[EN]I had to turn my numeric grades into letter grades.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_63.wav|Gary|[EN]And so this is the distribution of the monkey. This is the PDF of the monkey grades.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_64.wav|Gary|[EN]Okay, what about C?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_65.wav|Gary|[EN]And the decoder is a lot simpler than the encoder.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_66.wav|Gary|[EN]So one of my favorite results here is why the fuselage face area is recruited for other tasks.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_67.wav|Gary|[EN]You get the weight changes for the whole feature map.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_68.wav|Gary|[EN]they call it ImageNet because they keep thinking it's a network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_69.wav|Gary|[EN]And as I mentioned before, notice the number of different feature channels gets bigger and bigger the deeper you go.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_70.wav|Gary|[EN]Like this is spinal tap.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_71.wav|Gary|[EN]So again, we're going to evaluate it by training a linear classifier.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_72.wav|Gary|[EN]So this is an autoregressive model.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_73.wav|Gary|[EN]and it's going to determine where that separating line is.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_74.wav|Gary|[EN]This guy is going to have a different set of weights because its delta is different. But they're going to be exactly the same because it's multiplied times 0.5 to change.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_75.wav|Gary|[EN]They tried changing the aspect ratio of the image.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_76.wav|Gary|[EN]So we figure out what the output delta is.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_77.wav|Gary|[EN]So, so far we've been doing.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_78.wav|Gary|[EN]So what we did was we trained on a subset of the training set until it converged.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_79.wav|Gary|[EN]So it's trying to emit actions.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_80.wav|Gary|[EN]And Herb Simon said, machines will be capable in 20 years of doing any work that a man can do.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_81.wav|Gary|[EN]One of the things to notice about this compare... So these are... There's multiple lines here because there's multiple networks.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_82.wav|Gary|[EN]and you can get features at different scales that way.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_83.wav|Gary|[EN]It uses one-hot encodings of letters.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_84.wav|Gary|[EN]But always good fun for a project, reinforcement learning.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_85.wav|Gary|[EN]So you're always trying to learn an estimate from an estimate.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_86.wav|Gary|[EN]How does it lead to cross-entropy for logistic regression?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_87.wav|Gary|[EN]So I'm going to not do this on the board. I'll do it on the slides.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_88.wav|Gary|[EN]Max pooling in VGG, strided convolution, average pooling in dense net.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_89.wav|Gary|[EN]You only have one output going up or down.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_90.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, what's true about GANs? Are they unsupervised?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_91.wav|Gary|[EN]So you're basically running the network backwards. You're taking the deltas and you're propagating them backwards.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_92.wav|Gary|[EN]that j is linear.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_93.wav|Gary|[EN]And initially, there's not much going on. They're just maybe counting pixels.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_94.wav|Gary|[EN]In retirement, I got three grants last year.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_95.wav|Gary|[EN]Momentum does not care about the alignment of the axes.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_96.wav|Gary|[EN]Again, you're just adding noise and then trying to reverse that noise.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_97.wav|Gary|[EN]You're trying to maximize this guy.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_98.wav|Gary|[EN]And the last question is, I'm a little bit curious, like, how do you train the pictures when you do the convolution?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_99.wav|Gary|[EN]That's basically where chat GPT is, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_100.wav|Gary|[EN]I assume they don't back propagate into the memory, but they might block the gradient from there.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_101.wav|Gary|[EN]And if it's like 86.5, then I add two points to everybody's grade.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_102.wav|Gary|[EN]And so as you get deeper and deeper in the network, it's still all organized in what we would say is retinotopic coordinates.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_103.wav|Gary|[EN]And then, so you get this weighted sum of the inputs.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_104.wav|Gary|[EN]So this is taking your neighbor and just averaging you together.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_105.wav|Gary|[EN]So if I say I like my coffee with cream and dog, you're surprised, because you expected me to say sugar.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_106.wav|Gary|[EN]So look, how do I, I can't do it concurrently.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_107.wav|Gary|[EN]And the goal is, now this is not used.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_108.wav|Gary|[EN]a typical clustering algorithm is unsupervised.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_109.wav|Gary|[EN]20,000 was the limit to keep things about the right, so that they're relatively equal in number.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_110.wav|Gary|[EN]I took 151B last quarter.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_111.wav|Gary|[EN]What's wrong with correlated inputs?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_112.wav|Gary|[EN]So that's crossover and mutation like genetic algorithms.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_113.wav|Gary|[EN]So perceptrons didn't have hidden units, but Rosenblatt assumed nonlinear pre-processing.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_114.wav|Gary|[EN]If you've searched under that move, then you can cache all that search and now do an even better search.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_115.wav|Gary|[EN]now. We want these two people to be mapped to different output vectors.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_116.wav|Gary|[EN]So even if it's a totally random binary image, you end up with smooth areas like this.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_117.wav|Gary|[EN]One of the networks was a slightly different version of the other.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_118.wav|Gary|[EN]And the way he did that was by simply copying the output back to the input and then having a set of weights that went into the hidden layer.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_119.wav|Gary|[EN]You're trying to drive it away from fake data.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_120.wav|Gary|[EN]discussed is basically you make your nose do this and you get these heavy creases here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_121.wav|Gary|[EN]And what they found was that color and cropping, cropping and color worked the best.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_122.wav|Gary|[EN]If this output is zero, nothing gets through.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_123.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, and for w0, the weight of the input's always active.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_124.wav|Gary|[EN]So anyway, OK, so what is unit one of pure encoding?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_125.wav|Gary|[EN]nickel and dime things.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_126.wav|Gary|[EN]it turned out to be pretty damn hard for the students.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_127.wav|Gary|[EN]So I advise you to wear masks even though it's not required anymore.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_128.wav|Gary|[EN]thinks this is a baseball, and you can see why it might think that. It looks like the stitches on a baseball.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_129.wav|Gary|[EN]So let's see, 306.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_130.wav|Gary|[EN]So Atari games are an old video game console thing.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_131.wav|Gary|[EN]So the first one is gonna be the forward-forward algorithm.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_132.wav|Gary|[EN]It's whatever the network needs to remember.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_133.wav|Gary|[EN]and you took the vector of the hidden unit activations for all occurrences of...[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_134.wav|Gary|[EN]And then you show the monkey in the network a new image that neither one's seen before.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_135.wav|Gary|[EN]And you move over one pixel, you get another one. You move over one pixel, you get another one.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_136.wav|Gary|[EN]In 2D, that looks like an ellipse.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_137.wav|Gary|[EN]to imagine robots that were good.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_138.wav|Gary|[EN]even though I proved it to him. Okay. In email.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_139.wav|Gary|[EN]It's been used to learn all sorts of things.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_140.wav|Gary|[EN]I think it's going to happen in the next 50 years. I'll be dead, luckily, but you won't, so you better be ready for it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_141.wav|Gary|[EN]So it's still recognizing this as a two mostly, even though there's all kinds of stuff going across it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_142.wav|Gary|[EN]It basically always produced the same Barack Obama picture.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_143.wav|Gary|[EN]And if white was right here, you'd have to roll a one to get off the board.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_144.wav|Gary|[EN]So, how does this lead to sum squared error for regression?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_145.wav|Gary|[EN]But cropping and color together gave the best results.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_146.wav|Gary|[EN]And we're going to check each one of them.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_147.wav|Gary|[EN]So yeah, so that's a good point.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_148.wav|Gary|[EN]So within just that last layer, you're also representing the location in your general image within just like 6 by 6 or whatever.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_149.wav|Gary|[EN]Suppose we have, just to make this concrete, suppose we have category three out of four outputs.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_150.wav|Gary|[EN]And these can be convolutional, which is how we usually deal with image data.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_151.wav|Gary|[EN]I just realized this, because it doesn't include your opponents.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_152.wav|Gary|[EN]Suppose I'm trying to send three words over a channel.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_153.wav|Gary|[EN]So 50% of the time I'm sending one bit, 50% of the time I'm sending two bits, and on average I'm sending one and a half bits.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_154.wav|Gary|[EN]So you choose a node to expand by the Q value, which is what the network outputs plus this exploration term.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_155.wav|Gary|[EN]But on the content addressable memory, do you have to read the entire memory out first to get the scoring done? Yeah.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_156.wav|Gary|[EN]And then they can communicate with each other through multiple steps.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_157.wav|Gary|[EN]That goes up to now 11.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_158.wav|Gary|[EN]There's a superior temporal sulcus for emotional things.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_159.wav|Gary|[EN]In order to do that, I think we need to take a lot more inspiration from the brain.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_160.wav|Gary|[EN]It's a sequential decision problem.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_161.wav|Gary|[EN]I might be able to get around that local minimum because it's adding some stochasticity. In expectation.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_162.wav|Gary|[EN]And that is what we did for many years in the 80s, because we didn't know any better.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_163.wav|Gary|[EN]and they encode them with their locations. So they tell you where they are in the image.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_164.wav|Gary|[EN]This guy is just going to be the slope of the activation function.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_165.wav|Gary|[EN]And logistic regression.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_166.wav|Gary|[EN]And the story there is a little complicated and I kind of alluded to it in my lecture, but I didn't really explain it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_167.wav|Gary|[EN]So you could generate a new video frame by frame by using CycleGAN on a per frame basis, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_168.wav|Gary|[EN]And then we can apply gradient descent and repeat this process a gazillion times, where a gazillion is a lot.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_169.wav|Gary|[EN]And that's the problem that LSTM solved.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_170.wav|Gary|[EN]So yes, the answer is false.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_171.wav|Gary|[EN]And if that small input is important, it'll take a long time for the network to learn to pay attention to it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_172.wav|Gary|[EN]and it's just got a couple of layers of weights to transform that.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_173.wav|Gary|[EN]he suggests starting with a small momentum and increasing it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_174.wav|Gary|[EN]So you can use these to predict the next word.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_175.wav|Gary|[EN]and I can't do anything now.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_176.wav|Gary|[EN]but better as transformers, where you have the same network at each location joined by a tension.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_177.wav|Gary|[EN]So there are 32 unique 64-dimensional vectors, because we've got 32 channels.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_178.wav|Gary|[EN]you should have learned about today in section.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_179.wav|Gary|[EN]And these are the results, which you can't see. So I blew one of them up.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_180.wav|Gary|[EN]And again, this is built in operation.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_181.wav|Gary|[EN]And again, as I said last time, if you put a square root over this, essentially what we're trying to do is for the whole training set is to get the outputs.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_182.wav|Gary|[EN]And this is generally a good thing if your output categories are mutually exclusive.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_183.wav|Gary|[EN]All right, so suppose our error surface, let's see.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_184.wav|Gary|[EN]And now I'm trying to estimate the rewards from there.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_185.wav|Gary|[EN]So it's picking what action type, when to do it, which units to apply it to, and where to, for example.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_186.wav|Gary|[EN]And for zero, he turned on the first pixel.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_187.wav|Gary|[EN]So it's not a good idea to learn to remember.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_188.wav|Gary|[EN]You get some output of the hidden units, which I'll call z here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_189.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, so what's wrong with back prop?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_190.wav|Gary|[EN]How do I know what its delta is? I have to know what the deltas here are, propagate them back until I get to here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_191.wav|Gary|[EN]and you would spend your time on the weekends figuring out some features, you'd come in on Monday.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_192.wav|Gary|[EN]So they trained it on a problem where they had two inputs.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_193.wav|Gary|[EN]Again, you have external input, external output.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_194.wav|Gary|[EN]Given a state of the board, it's outputting probability over moves based on how good they look.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_195.wav|Gary|[EN]We're going to define delta as minus the gradient of j with respect to the weighted sum of the inputs.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_196.wav|Gary|[EN]And that's, again, the stupid thing we did for a few years.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_197.wav|Gary|[EN]The main idea of ResNets is in the lower left corner here. I'm gonna have a one-to-one connection.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_198.wav|Gary|[EN]And you can also imagine, you may not know this yet, but you can have them learn a program.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_199.wav|Gary|[EN]It's greater than or equal to zero.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_200.wav|Gary|[EN]So you're trying to minimize the error while minimizing the network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_201.wav|Gary|[EN]Nice, I don't know what makes them nice.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_202.wav|Gary|[EN]So remember that stable diffusion does the same thing, diffusion models, but on latent representations.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_203.wav|Gary|[EN]So again, what happened?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_204.wav|Gary|[EN]You have a 2 3rds chance that your neighbor is right.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_205.wav|Gary|[EN]No, I mean unique, one-dimensional vectors.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_206.wav|Gary|[EN]So the neural Turing machine, the main idea is to add this structured memory to a neural controller that it can write to and read from.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_207.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, so reading. This i is over every row of the memory.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_208.wav|Gary|[EN]So let's see if this happens in practice.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_209.wav|Gary|[EN]They're just trained to predict the next word.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_210.wav|Gary|[EN]You probably have other questions.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_211.wav|Gary|[EN]All right, one or two more here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_212.wav|Gary|[EN]So it's only true for autoregressive networks.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_213.wav|Gary|[EN]So you're trying to minimize squared error between them or make the squared error between them go up if they're supposed to be different categories.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_214.wav|Gary|[EN]and we're gonna get a good start on PA2 tonight.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_215.wav|Gary|[EN]So why is sending something from the blue distribution less informative than sending something from the yellow distribution?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_216.wav|Gary|[EN]And so we're going to get a similar kind of thing where the outgoing weights from each input will be the same.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_217.wav|Gary|[EN]And you can think of each row of the weight matrix as being the weights to one of the outputs.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_218.wav|Gary|[EN]They took this transcription of a six-year-old boy talking.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_219.wav|Gary|[EN]And so that's a slightly different kind of search.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_220.wav|Gary|[EN]This is audience participation.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_221.wav|Gary|[EN]You're trying to train an oscillator, for example.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_222.wav|Gary|[EN]So you've got everywhere there's a yellow block, that's a softmax.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_223.wav|Gary|[EN]But if they're 5 by 5 patches, he's got, I don't know. This is 32 by 32.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_224.wav|Gary|[EN]again. And these chapters in Dive Into Deep Learning might be off by one.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_225.wav|Gary|[EN]And what he expects is that because max pooling works so well, it won't work quite as well as max pooling.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_226.wav|Gary|[EN]There's a 3x3 patch for this one and a 3x3 patch for that one.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_227.wav|Gary|[EN]All right, so let's just pretend that that's all we know about reinforcement learning.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_228.wav|Gary|[EN]not quite as good as supervised learning, but getting there.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_229.wav|Gary|[EN]Pixels depend most on nearby pixels, locality.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_230.wav|Gary|[EN]So if you have discrete states in action, it can be a big, I guess this is a tensor.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_231.wav|Gary|[EN]And so the closest zebra-like thing it can build from this is just turning the horse into a zebra.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_232.wav|Gary|[EN]So these are very large pixels.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_233.wav|Gary|[EN]and they used a resonant with batch norm.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_234.wav|Gary|[EN]If we're good programmers, we just have one set of weights, but we keep reusing them over and over.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_235.wav|Gary|[EN]I worked on facial expressions early in the day, faces, etc.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_236.wav|Gary|[EN]So if we're very confident, if we think, yeah, this is gonna be a one, and wrong, it's gonna take a long time to get over that.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_237.wav|Gary|[EN]But things kept going like that.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_238.wav|Gary|[EN]No. Make an unbalanced tennis set more balanced.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_239.wav|Gary|[EN]And it's actually a weighted sum between the two.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_240.wav|Gary|[EN]And this is the result of a simulation one of my students did years ago.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_241.wav|Gary|[EN]either that same layer or a previous layer.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_242.wav|Gary|[EN]you could have one by one convolutions.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_243.wav|Gary|[EN]And so you can see what's going on.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_244.wav|Gary|[EN]And so you do all this work and you get a graph.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_245.wav|Gary|[EN]And then the Q values for the state you just came from will be updated based on that.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_246.wav|Gary|[EN]And the key difference between these is that for stable diffusion models, they don't operate in pixel space.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_247.wav|Gary|[EN]you've got a Jennifer Aniston neuron.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_248.wav|Gary|[EN]And in this case, there's a fairly simple way to do that.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_249.wav|Gary|[EN]And that's Gil Scott-Heron.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_250.wav|Gary|[EN]So yeah, so that's it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_251.wav|Gary|[EN]This also, Mike Jordan used this.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_252.wav|Gary|[EN]So this image at the top was reconstructed.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_253.wav|Gary|[EN]So he's going to make a recurrent net that he trains all at once.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_254.wav|Gary|[EN]here I'm applying the chain rule again, over how the error goes down.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_255.wav|Gary|[EN]And the green is convolution, pooling, and softmax.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_256.wav|Gary|[EN]So the minimum of this is the same as the minimum of this without the sigma in there.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_257.wav|Gary|[EN]The only successful neural network company for a long time was Robert Heck Nielsen's company.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_258.wav|Gary|[EN]So that's much smaller, dimensional.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_259.wav|Gary|[EN]So that's how it works.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_260.wav|Gary|[EN]and make someone do or say something.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_261.wav|Gary|[EN]And Jeff's approach is very useful when you don't have a target sequence.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_262.wav|Gary|[EN]Okay, so again, down here is the gradient.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_263.wav|Gary|[EN]But anyway, he trained it two different ways.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_264.wav|Gary|[EN]And PCA provably minimizes the squared error of the data.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_265.wav|Gary|[EN]and its job is to reproduce the whole image.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_266.wav|Gary|[EN]one that takes an image from one domain and tries to generate an image from another domain.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_267.wav|Gary|[EN]So what's wrong with this picture in the land of big data?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_268.wav|Gary|[EN]So you're trying to minimize the squared error between the Q value for the state you just came from.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_269.wav|Gary|[EN]So the perceptron will never converge.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_270.wav|Gary|[EN]So I'm gonna go on to continents then if we're ready for that.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_271.wav|Gary|[EN]It was just boy smash plate, girl like boy.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_272.wav|Gary|[EN]So I want to lower weights to active inputs.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_273.wav|Gary|[EN]That's also, I also call that the net input. G is the activation function, and we're gonna use the logistic activation function.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_274.wav|Gary|[EN]usually has a larger central hidden layer than the input.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_275.wav|Gary|[EN]Not necessarily, but the weights could be negative, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_276.wav|Gary|[EN]And for midterms, you're allowed to bring a cheat sheet, 8.5 by 11 sheet of paper with notes on one side only.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_277.wav|Gary|[EN]If you double the error derivatives at the output layer, all the error derivatives are gonna double.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_278.wav|Gary|[EN]So I'm going to make 90 out of them, amplify my data set.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_279.wav|Gary|[EN]And I'm just going to cut out the middle of this to illustrate the point.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_280.wav|Gary|[EN]So this looks a lot like that.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_281.wav|Gary|[EN]Well, it's an easy way to do it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_282.wav|Gary|[EN]So I don't think I have to do this twice because it went by so slow.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_283.wav|Gary|[EN]basically what you're trying to do is you're trying to increase the output of the discriminator network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_284.wav|Gary|[EN]For those of you who couldn't hear her, she said, you could have the weights be one and the threshold be one.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_285.wav|Gary|[EN]So then AlphaGo Zero came along.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_286.wav|Gary|[EN]Any more questions? Any questions from who? How does backprop work in Q-learning?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_287.wav|Gary|[EN]Okay, here's another clicker question.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_288.wav|Gary|[EN]What batch normalization does is z-score that weighted sum of its inputs over the mini-batch.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_289.wav|Gary|[EN]So the y-axis is y2.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_290.wav|Gary|[EN]They can see where you live, where you work.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_291.wav|Gary|[EN]So you have a different gown for each one of these.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_292.wav|Gary|[EN]So again, if the two inputs are from the same category, minimize the distance between them.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_293.wav|Gary|[EN]And then you can do a grid search, essentially, where you just try a full grid of possible hyperparameters.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_294.wav|Gary|[EN]And now my slides are not advancing.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_295.wav|Gary|[EN]And that's a hallucination, because it's an estimate.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_296.wav|Gary|[EN]And if I give the network 2, then I give it this one, too.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_297.wav|Gary|[EN]So alpha's become big near the deepest layer early in training and then drop back to small values.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_298.wav|Gary|[EN]And so that's how they trained this deep network by, it's called deep supervision.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_299.wav|Gary|[EN]Let's take the gamma out so it all fits on one line.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_300.wav|Gary|[EN]This innervates object and face areas.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_301.wav|Gary|[EN]So let's look at these feature maps or activation maps.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_302.wav|Gary|[EN]Then we're going to take in this column and remember that there was a carry. Then we're going to take this column and etc.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_303.wav|Gary|[EN]False. That would be really surprising.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_304.wav|Gary|[EN]Let's look at one without the answers.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_305.wav|Gary|[EN]Please go buy a clicker. The web or the app for clickers.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_306.wav|Gary|[EN]If you had a two hidden layer network, it'd be a relatively shallow network, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_307.wav|Gary|[EN]and Joe Biden and sending him over here by the final layer.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_308.wav|Gary|[EN]You need both a replicated feature across the image and some sort of spatial pooling.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_309.wav|Gary|[EN]I think I played Net Talk for you, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_310.wav|Gary|[EN]And then the second programming assignment is backprop with one or two hidden layers.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_311.wav|Gary|[EN]So hopefully we get in some cool stuff after this.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_312.wav|Gary|[EN]And then the softmax is trained after training the network to actually predict what this character is, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_313.wav|Gary|[EN]Now that's not completely true.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_314.wav|Gary|[EN]Then you're propagating the deltas backwards through the network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_315.wav|Gary|[EN]The discriminator can get way ahead of the generator, providing little feedback.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_316.wav|Gary|[EN]But when you get uploaded, they have this big machine that's uploading your brain.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_317.wav|Gary|[EN]So the error with respect to the weighted sum of the inputs is the sum.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_318.wav|Gary|[EN]We've seen perceptrons, which produces this off-on response.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_319.wav|Gary|[EN]And let's say we exactly turn half off.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_320.wav|Gary|[EN]And then later in the network, you're pooling together larger things.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_321.wav|Gary|[EN]You can produce a word or a sentence, or you can caption an image.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_322.wav|Gary|[EN]I think. You need something.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_323.wav|Gary|[EN]a little three-layer net that learns its weights adaptively.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_324.wav|Gary|[EN]and it won't remember them because it doesn't have a memory.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_325.wav|Gary|[EN]Like I like my coffee with cream and dog.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_326.wav|Gary|[EN]This claim relies on a combination of two known research observations.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_327.wav|Gary|[EN]Can you hear me? Go through the mic.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_328.wav|Gary|[EN]But I was kind of surprised at first.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_329.wav|Gary|[EN]So and this is showing that it's learned to linearly separate at least three of the categories.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_330.wav|Gary|[EN]So these are the two outputs, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_331.wav|Gary|[EN]So you compute the gradient, change the weights.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_332.wav|Gary|[EN]If it's way better, this will be positive, and I'll increase the value of the action in the state I just came from.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_333.wav|Gary|[EN]I mean, it's just amazing that it can do this.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_334.wav|Gary|[EN]And LSTM units revolutionized recurrent networks, allowing them to learn all sorts of tasks.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_335.wav|Gary|[EN]So how do you decide when to stop?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_336.wav|Gary|[EN]But you can also use it in shallow networks.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_337.wav|Gary|[EN]where to put them or where to target things.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_338.wav|Gary|[EN]You get 10% off for a day late, 20% off for two days late, and 50% off for three days late, and more than that, 100%.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_339.wav|Gary|[EN]then you back propagate that error into the network and change the weights.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_340.wav|Gary|[EN]And that's where things like Lynette, or sorry, that's where things, well, that's where Lynette came from.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_341.wav|Gary|[EN]There are still some artifacts in here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_342.wav|Gary|[EN]You don't have to write down as many numbers.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_343.wav|Gary|[EN]About half of you are saying A and about half are saying B.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_344.wav|Gary|[EN]As you'll see in your programming assignment.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_345.wav|Gary|[EN]So the assumption of a Gaussian gave us this form.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_346.wav|Gary|[EN]sadly, so cool victory.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_347.wav|Gary|[EN]and that's good because your brain's a recurrent network and we're trying to do artificial intelligence.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_348.wav|Gary|[EN]So this is temporal difference learning because this is a temporal difference error.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_349.wav|Gary|[EN]So we know for the output units with the right activation function and objective function that that becomes t minus y.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_350.wav|Gary|[EN]And what that means is what we hope to do with that is get a good sample of the data.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_351.wav|Gary|[EN]But by going to the board, I have to slow down.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_352.wav|Gary|[EN]So all vectors z, these guys that we get up here, are normalized to length 1.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_353.wav|Gary|[EN]Remember, when we're changing the weight, we need the delta of j.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_354.wav|Gary|[EN]So the Atari player from DeepMind was yet another nature paper.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_355.wav|Gary|[EN]Is it the owner or is it the machine itself?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_356.wav|Gary|[EN]In PCA, the eigenvalue on that eigenvector is the variance along that eigenvector.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_357.wav|Gary|[EN]and maybe they're 14 by 14.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_358.wav|Gary|[EN]So if it was 0, 1, 0, 0, we'd add 0 and 1 and get 1.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_359.wav|Gary|[EN]Now we've got six channels for six different feature maps.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_360.wav|Gary|[EN]And then we've got BGAN. And this is when it started appearing in the newspapers.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_361.wav|Gary|[EN]And computing the cross-correlation matrix, or the covariance matrix, is differentiable.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_362.wav|Gary|[EN]And depending on the size of your filter, you might need padding around the outside.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_363.wav|Gary|[EN]The max pooling operation when combined with convolution introduces some amount of translation invariance.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_364.wav|Gary|[EN]Z is G of A.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_365.wav|Gary|[EN]So that's where batch normalization comes in.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_366.wav|Gary|[EN]Aside from the fact that it's a transformer. So here's the results.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_367.wav|Gary|[EN]So you're looking ahead based on your estimates of how good things are.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_368.wav|Gary|[EN]which has negative and positive outputs is better.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_369.wav|Gary|[EN]The other thing you can do, and I tried to implement this and I don't think I ever got it right.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_370.wav|Gary|[EN]You take similar images, you want them to be closer together than different images.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_371.wav|Gary|[EN]So they do this thing called Monte Carlo tree search.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_372.wav|Gary|[EN]And then we had two digits as input to two bit digits.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_373.wav|Gary|[EN]And you can think of it as exploring an exponential number of models. And we'll see why that is.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_374.wav|Gary|[EN]So when T of n is 1 and y of n is 1, the expression would be 0.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_375.wav|Gary|[EN]Yeah, so increasing M will push the clusters farther apart.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_376.wav|Gary|[EN]So there's quite a bit of work on this.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_377.wav|Gary|[EN]This is the feature map.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_378.wav|Gary|[EN]And this is just replacing the net input with its expression.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_379.wav|Gary|[EN]We have a demo face recognition that I will use in class.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_380.wav|Gary|[EN]And then the final layer is going to be like a one-hot encoding of the targets.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_381.wav|Gary|[EN]The loss for a positive pair is this. So a positive, oh wait.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_382.wav|Gary|[EN]Because, jeez, that's not letting me do anything.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_383.wav|Gary|[EN]So an SVM is a support vector machine, and it is basically a perceptron on steroids.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_384.wav|Gary|[EN]And the function that computes those in the context of the other towers, the outputs of the other towers.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_385.wav|Gary|[EN]And then Romel, Art Hinton, and Williams did an 8.38 auto encoder to illustrate backprop.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_386.wav|Gary|[EN]You wanted a chance to make law. Well, here it is. Make it a good one.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_387.wav|Gary|[EN]what units should be on in the output, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_388.wav|Gary|[EN]And this can be used in cases where you want to know if something's different from what you experienced or not.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_389.wav|Gary|[EN]Okay, so if you cheat on an assignment or a test, you'll get zero for that.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_390.wav|Gary|[EN]And then I showed you this. And this one.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_391.wav|Gary|[EN]That's 17 of you said that. You would get this wrong on a test.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_392.wav|Gary|[EN]three by three features seem to work well.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_393.wav|Gary|[EN]but what we actually see is a corrupted version of that, with that being the mean.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_394.wav|Gary|[EN]So you give it a whole sentence and you might leave out one word somewhere and it has to fill in the missing word.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_395.wav|Gary|[EN]S comma A led to S prime.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_396.wav|Gary|[EN]independently identically distributed.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_397.wav|Gary|[EN]And then Rommel-Haritz idea, w squared over w squared plus one or plus c, you can have some constant there.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_398.wav|Gary|[EN]A single data, and forgive me, Commander, is a curiosity.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_399.wav|Gary|[EN]There are many routine human tasks that can and will be automated.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_400.wav|Gary|[EN]Because when I do that, I can just sum up the result, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_401.wav|Gary|[EN]If we had E here, it would be called Nats.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_402.wav|Gary|[EN]And you get these kind of salience maps, like where it's paying attention to.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_403.wav|Gary|[EN]And so these are UCSD undergrads and grad students, and they're making the six basic facial expressions.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_404.wav|Gary|[EN]These are always the same for one feature map.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_405.wav|Gary|[EN]Sorry. It actually got better the shallower we went. But it still wasn't very good.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_406.wav|Gary|[EN]And copies it, copies it, copies it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_407.wav|Gary|[EN]And you can think of autonomous weapons as the third revolution in warfare after gunpowder and nuclear arms.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_408.wav|Gary|[EN]And then you can use that to say if you're right or wrong and get a percent correct.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_409.wav|Gary|[EN]This is just a formula for the Gaussian distribution in one dimension.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_410.wav|Gary|[EN]These are what you computed by DECOMNET.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_411.wav|Gary|[EN]Almost everything in the world is Gaussian, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_412.wav|Gary|[EN]And then he had a rating from one to five.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_413.wav|Gary|[EN]And going, going, going, gone. And 72% of you would get it right.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_414.wav|Gary|[EN]Since you can use an RNN for similar things that you would use a CNN.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_415.wav|Gary|[EN]and then sum them up when we're done.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_416.wav|Gary|[EN]So again, this is the picture of exactly what you do.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_417.wav|Gary|[EN]And so the gradient is always the same.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_418.wav|Gary|[EN]The problem is that you've got a learning rate.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_419.wav|Gary|[EN]So it's got the truth table for NAND.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_420.wav|Gary|[EN]further training made it not do that anymore.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_421.wav|Gary|[EN]So training proceeds by giving the generator some random noise input, which leads to something usually junk as output.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_422.wav|Gary|[EN]Those two should be the same, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_423.wav|Gary|[EN]You cannot use mean pooling to achieve translation invariance.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_424.wav|Gary|[EN]He says when he adds this one in, he gets worse results.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_425.wav|Gary|[EN]There's a question in the chat. I'm confused about how it is a base for supervised learning.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_426.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, so you sample from that distribution. If it's 0.8, you're likely to move up and less likely to move down, et cetera.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_427.wav|Gary|[EN]So not all the bicycles are bicycles.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_428.wav|Gary|[EN]whereas the Perceptron only has a 0 or 1 output.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_429.wav|Gary|[EN]and then use the weights in the other direction, just like propagating the deltas.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_430.wav|Gary|[EN]Number two is this one.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_431.wav|Gary|[EN]So it's run for 10 iterations and negative examples are again just ones with incorrect labels.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_432.wav|Gary|[EN]and not very much in the way of summarizing here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_433.wav|Gary|[EN]You can wear a mask, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_434.wav|Gary|[EN]So it would take a space, a B, an A, an N, an A, an N, an A.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_435.wav|Gary|[EN]And it's recording. I don't see the little record thing.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_436.wav|Gary|[EN]The main point of telling you about Piazza is that the slides are there.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_437.wav|Gary|[EN]What is delta associated with in this weight change rule?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_438.wav|Gary|[EN]It's going to get people out of jobs, though, but it is going to do a lot of good things for us.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_439.wav|Gary|[EN]the delta for the hidden units is always the slope of that activation function times the weighted sum of the deltas.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_440.wav|Gary|[EN]Of course, if you look closely enough, you'll see some things don't look quite right.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_441.wav|Gary|[EN]We're not propagating information from the past to the future.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_442.wav|Gary|[EN]No. They're the outputs of the network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_443.wav|Gary|[EN]So this is his zip code recognizer for some reason.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_444.wav|Gary|[EN]And so now it really has to learn some features that distinguish positive from negative inputs.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_445.wav|Gary|[EN]Now here we're dropping layers 3 and 4, and that only drops a million parameters.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_446.wav|Gary|[EN]It's a Gaussian distribution with the red line being the mean of that Gaussian.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_447.wav|Gary|[EN]so they're not going to help distinguish among the images.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_448.wav|Gary|[EN]meaning the rest is just noise that's not explainable.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_449.wav|Gary|[EN]It says, deep learning works.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_450.wav|Gary|[EN]Monte Carlo because Monte Carlo is a city with a lot of gambling.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_451.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, so imagine that we're using sigmoidal activation functions in our units.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_452.wav|Gary|[EN]so that it's not just playing against itself over and over again because then it would get into one of these vicious cycles.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_453.wav|Gary|[EN]But in the end, and I don't expect you to answer this on a test.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_454.wav|Gary|[EN]Lillian Lee, I think her last name is, has a really good podcast. Sorry.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_455.wav|Gary|[EN]And so that's it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_456.wav|Gary|[EN]But one I think is that it's got this kind of built-in search with the rolling dice.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_457.wav|Gary|[EN]So the class ends with a movie, a short movie.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_458.wav|Gary|[EN]You take the two closest vectors, say by cosine or Euclidean distance, and you average those two together.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_459.wav|Gary|[EN]And the next good idea was CycleGAN.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_460.wav|Gary|[EN]We don't care exactly what the output is, but you can do this for any category and make it think it's that category.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_461.wav|Gary|[EN]It's not even learning. It's too high.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_462.wav|Gary|[EN]Or another example that we gave in class was going from handwriting to text.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_463.wav|Gary|[EN]And this is the CAFE data set.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_464.wav|Gary|[EN]Rommelhart, Hinton, and Williams originally derived a learning rule using squared error as the objective function.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_465.wav|Gary|[EN]this is the text embedded in the photo of a car and now you give it a photo.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_466.wav|Gary|[EN]The third most important thing is that it learns internal representations.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_467.wav|Gary|[EN]and that way and switch drivers during the assignment.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_468.wav|Gary|[EN]And then you look at the states you can get to from there. And you look at the states you can get to from there.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_469.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, so that's what he did.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_470.wav|Gary|[EN]Now the question is, I've got all of these hidden units.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_471.wav|Gary|[EN]And they can also behave systematically, translating one sentence in one language into another.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_472.wav|Gary|[EN]However, if you get COVID or your roommate gets COVID and you have to take care of him or you have to fly home because your grandfather got COVID and is dying.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_473.wav|Gary|[EN]And then I can just interpolate between them.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_474.wav|Gary|[EN]So they're starting to get a little bit more categorical.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_475.wav|Gary|[EN]So this is your cross-validation thing.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_476.wav|Gary|[EN]The reason is that there's a topological difference between the two.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_477.wav|Gary|[EN]I don't have any new funny stories for you, good luck.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_478.wav|Gary|[EN]And so that's what this is showing, is you shift it up or shift it down.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_479.wav|Gary|[EN]So having more feature maps means you have more ways to separate the categories. You've got.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_480.wav|Gary|[EN]So instead of our previous one, notice here the difference is.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_481.wav|Gary|[EN]Now the generator is trying to minimize this expression.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_482.wav|Gary|[EN]So it's a kind of average pooling.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_483.wav|Gary|[EN]So what we're showing on top here is four different crops of the same image.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_484.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, that's it for this lecture.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_485.wav|Gary|[EN]Anyway, both of these have a square root of the fan in and the fan out in this case.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_486.wav|Gary|[EN]So I think I might have asked this of you before.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_487.wav|Gary|[EN]And I can learn gender with one hidden unit pretty well.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_488.wav|Gary|[EN]but while it was a big team. So it's really a complicated system, not just one network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_489.wav|Gary|[EN]So since then, there's been several different systems that learned to play it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_490.wav|Gary|[EN]And I do that for every other guy here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_491.wav|Gary|[EN]and that leads to what our prop is.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_492.wav|Gary|[EN]What's interesting about AlphaStar is it's an imperfect information game, unlike Go, where you can see the whole board.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_493.wav|Gary|[EN]all right, but E is the best answer because we can do dimensionality reduction.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_494.wav|Gary|[EN]I thought that was, who knew?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_495.wav|Gary|[EN]And then information can be stored in the cell by having a write gate that allows input from the rest of the recurrent network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_496.wav|Gary|[EN]and they said, imagine this technology in public hands.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_497.wav|Gary|[EN]So machine learning can now detect cancer.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_498.wav|Gary|[EN]You don't have to label anything, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_499.wav|Gary|[EN]So, which of those is it?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_500.wav|Gary|[EN]by looking at the statistical regularities in the words.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_501.wav|Gary|[EN]And what we want to do is find those parameters that maximize the likelihood of the data, maximize the probability of the data.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_502.wav|Gary|[EN]And by having, we used to call this a localist representation.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_503.wav|Gary|[EN]So right now you're doing a forward pass for the entire implicit.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_504.wav|Gary|[EN]And we're going to design our network to have those properties, to reflect those properties.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_505.wav|Gary|[EN]So I go from a three by three to a five by five. I could then go to seven by seven.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_506.wav|Gary|[EN]So ConNets had some early successes.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_507.wav|Gary|[EN]but it's got a value network that's looking at the current value of the board and that critiques what the agent does, the actor.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_508.wav|Gary|[EN]So anyway, that's supposed to be a little bit of fun.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_509.wav|Gary|[EN]And so there's a three by three patch for this one.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_510.wav|Gary|[EN]And then I was going to go through some thoughts about the ethics of AI.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_511.wav|Gary|[EN]Anything change between those two? No. OK.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_512.wav|Gary|[EN]And then in the bottom is all the other pairs.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_513.wav|Gary|[EN]Hopefully that clears up something.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_514.wav|Gary|[EN]So we're not estimating the value yet. This is actual value. So these are made up, obviously.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_515.wav|Gary|[EN]So that's where its memory is.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_516.wav|Gary|[EN]when you send me an email and say I sent you an email, could you read it?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_517.wav|Gary|[EN]Maybe all the way to the end of the game, or maybe just some depth.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_518.wav|Gary|[EN]and instead of coming up with features that they apply when they get into work on Monday.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_519.wav|Gary|[EN]So again, this is a review and some more remarks on.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_520.wav|Gary|[EN]So that's in the front of your temporal lobe.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_521.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, then that's GANs, autoencoders, neural Turing machines, recurrent networks, LSTMs.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_522.wav|Gary|[EN]So CIFAR-10 is 32 by 32 images with 10 categories.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_523.wav|Gary|[EN]Delta associated with the inputs, with the unit.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_524.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, so how to train these big convolutional networks.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_525.wav|Gary|[EN]And the policy takes in a state, and it produces a distribution over possible actions given that state.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_526.wav|Gary|[EN]So a little bit of, required a bit of thought.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_527.wav|Gary|[EN]Uh, let's see.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_528.wav|Gary|[EN]You give the generator network random noise.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_529.wav|Gary|[EN]Oh yeah, and there's a reference to his paper from 1956.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_530.wav|Gary|[EN]This one computes a carry out of this place.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_531.wav|Gary|[EN]Yes. So we had to do it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_532.wav|Gary|[EN]You compute the deltas at the output.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_533.wav|Gary|[EN]So you're going to combine those two estimates of the value of a particular move.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_534.wav|Gary|[EN]or you can push the red button, or you can move it in eight different directions and push the red button.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_535.wav|Gary|[EN]It's not any different than what we've been doing.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_536.wav|Gary|[EN]And so what the agent then learns is a policy, a function from states to action probabilities.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_537.wav|Gary|[EN]with things at right angles to it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_538.wav|Gary|[EN]This one doesn't turn on because it's minus 3 plus 0, and you get minus 4.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_539.wav|Gary|[EN]And ever since we got deep networks, they've been able to do amazing things.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_540.wav|Gary|[EN]And that's Monte Carlo Tree Search.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_541.wav|Gary|[EN]Of course, there wasn't deep learning back then, at least not much.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_542.wav|Gary|[EN]reporters who are such scum losers they won't even love me.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_543.wav|Gary|[EN]I do that over here for another pixel.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_544.wav|Gary|[EN]And surprisingly, these big language models, the ones that do prediction of the next word.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_545.wav|Gary|[EN]Or you can go talk to Zhu Wen Tu in Cogsci. He seems to know everything.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_546.wav|Gary|[EN]It's the one in Chapter 8 of the Old Testament, the PDP Books, Volume 1.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_547.wav|Gary|[EN]And so the agent's life consists of state, action, reward, state, action, reward, state.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_548.wav|Gary|[EN]It's just where the delta is just t minus y.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_549.wav|Gary|[EN]And maybe it just barely got cut off.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_550.wav|Gary|[EN]Here, the first unit in the input would be turned on and the rest would be zero.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_551.wav|Gary|[EN]and it's still linear in the variables.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_552.wav|Gary|[EN]we wouldn't get squared error, we'd get something else.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_553.wav|Gary|[EN]Let's see, I have to get out of, oh, there it is.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_554.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, so for the first layer, no difference. Everything's fine.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_555.wav|Gary|[EN]In fact, it does that on all of them.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_556.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, let's get started.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_557.wav|Gary|[EN]sometimes the questions are ones only I can answer.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_558.wav|Gary|[EN]So it means that the thing can go on forever.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_559.wav|Gary|[EN]I don't actually know if they, I assume they don't. Casey, no.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_560.wav|Gary|[EN]And so it doesn't propagate activation here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_561.wav|Gary|[EN]I guess you can't see it behind this.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_562.wav|Gary|[EN]One with the right two hidden units, one with the left two hidden units, et cetera.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_563.wav|Gary|[EN]He gets 1.37% error.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_564.wav|Gary|[EN]And again, that's useful if we don't know what the features ought to be.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_565.wav|Gary|[EN]Any car battery? Car factory.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_566.wav|Gary|[EN]And that's what a lot of research is working on right now.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_567.wav|Gary|[EN]Well, that's essentially what Jeff did.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_568.wav|Gary|[EN]He died while I was there in a mysterious boating accident on Chesapeake Bay on his birthday.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_569.wav|Gary|[EN]It takes in input and that's what this slide was showing.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_570.wav|Gary|[EN]This is the Stanford site.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_571.wav|Gary|[EN]So two hidden units, not two hidden layers, two hidden units.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_572.wav|Gary|[EN]But in either case, it is the input on that line.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_573.wav|Gary|[EN]So we call these agents exploiter agents.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_574.wav|Gary|[EN]That's why chat GPT is bad for you.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_575.wav|Gary|[EN]Okay, so you're trying to make those outputs that you just generated more real.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_576.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, so that's the summary from last time.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_577.wav|Gary|[EN]How about E?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_578.wav|Gary|[EN]We don't put in teacher signals into our kids' brains, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_579.wav|Gary|[EN]And then fourth one is LSTM networks.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_580.wav|Gary|[EN]So at each load, it's got seven input locations.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_581.wav|Gary|[EN]And I did see somebody give a talk that I didn't see the talk, where they said they could find the lottery ticket. But I'm not sure.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_582.wav|Gary|[EN]I used to say that you couldn't get the perceptron rule by gradient descent.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_583.wav|Gary|[EN]And okay, so SimClear, I've already told you about.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_584.wav|Gary|[EN]So you can apply this to transformers.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_585.wav|Gary|[EN]Say there's a carry, ask for the next column, or say that I'm done.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_586.wav|Gary|[EN]So the likelihood of all of the data, then, is the product of those likelihoods.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_587.wav|Gary|[EN]One was to map time into space, like NetTalk.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_588.wav|Gary|[EN]And the answer is not E. You joker.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_589.wav|Gary|[EN]it's going to generalize to a lot of other things.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_590.wav|Gary|[EN]Is everybody pushed their button? Because I'm only getting 50 out of the 60.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_591.wav|Gary|[EN]And so you might want to train more on.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_592.wav|Gary|[EN]If you have a big error and I have a small weight to you, I don't care as much.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_593.wav|Gary|[EN]That's the theme song to Twilight Zone.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_594.wav|Gary|[EN]Soon we're going to have logistic units.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_595.wav|Gary|[EN]So it doesn't come off.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_596.wav|Gary|[EN]just publishes papers and never actually gives you the source code for anything.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_597.wav|Gary|[EN]So just take two points on this line.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_598.wav|Gary|[EN]and look at the normalized images and make sure they look like they're normalized.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_599.wav|Gary|[EN]And then there's a result output to write the actual digit that should be there.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_600.wav|Gary|[EN]So that's good training result.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_601.wav|Gary|[EN]Down here it's probably not going to be linearly separable, but it will be more linearly separable maybe than the image.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_602.wav|Gary|[EN]And I don't know whether they had a slightly stretched logistic.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_603.wav|Gary|[EN]And people wrote TNF over here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_604.wav|Gary|[EN]He's a computer scientist collecting a.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_605.wav|Gary|[EN]You don't say that about, you don't say yellow banana.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_606.wav|Gary|[EN]Now sooner or later this man, or others like him, will succeed in replicating Commander Data.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_607.wav|Gary|[EN]And that's my story and I'm sticking to it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_608.wav|Gary|[EN]because things are various distances in pictures.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_609.wav|Gary|[EN]Imagine that the cosine is 0.8, 0.1, 0.1.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_610.wav|Gary|[EN]So these were objects that Isabelle Gauthier at Vanderbilt created with 3D Studio Max.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_611.wav|Gary|[EN]Although you can't share all the weights because one's bigger than the other, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_612.wav|Gary|[EN]So the goal here is to build an anatomically constrained model of the human visual system.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_613.wav|Gary|[EN]It's also called an MDP for Markov Decision Problem.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_614.wav|Gary|[EN]The names have been changed to protect the innocent.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_615.wav|Gary|[EN]by the early 2000s exoskeletal limbs would be let the disabled walk and people are building things like that.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_616.wav|Gary|[EN]The revolution will not be televised.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_617.wav|Gary|[EN]Cafe being the data set we collected.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_618.wav|Gary|[EN]And so I'll talk about what clip is, and I'll talk about what diffusion is.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_619.wav|Gary|[EN]Let's see if we can get him distracted.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_620.wav|Gary|[EN]just plug in my phone, maybe switch to my phone.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_621.wav|Gary|[EN]So, Kaiming He, that's Kaiming initialization, Kaiming did this.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_622.wav|Gary|[EN]So these are all the ones in this lecture.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_623.wav|Gary|[EN]And in fact, another example is ReLu units, which are like this.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_624.wav|Gary|[EN]And so what happens is you have smaller and smaller error corrections.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_625.wav|Gary|[EN]And you hope that because they start out with different initial random weights, the mistakes they make are going to be uncorrelated.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_626.wav|Gary|[EN]I'm giving a little extension for people in that situation.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_627.wav|Gary|[EN]And it's pretty detailed.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_628.wav|Gary|[EN]And so by doing this, they're able to learn dynamics.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_629.wav|Gary|[EN]And so for the hidden units.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_630.wav|Gary|[EN]And she left her phone, too.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_631.wav|Gary|[EN]As if we had base 10, but ours was base 4, or base 2. Base 2.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_632.wav|Gary|[EN]but they're not trained to any particular output.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_633.wav|Gary|[EN]So that's the likelihood, that's the log likelihood, and we can call the negative log likelihood the error.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_634.wav|Gary|[EN]Somebody's very pleased to have Wally.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_635.wav|Gary|[EN]Image statistics vary based on location in the image, variable statistics.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_636.wav|Gary|[EN]You can add Gaussian noise to the hidden unit activations.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_637.wav|Gary|[EN]What that means is you let TD-Gammon, so you're in some state.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_638.wav|Gary|[EN]since it was all feed forward back then.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_639.wav|Gary|[EN]So this is the normal cycle loss, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_640.wav|Gary|[EN]So you're gonna go, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_641.wav|Gary|[EN]And now the discriminator output is 0.5 everywhere because it can't tell real from fake anymore.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_642.wav|Gary|[EN]So this is the human data.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_643.wav|Gary|[EN]Max pooling is a fixed operation.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_644.wav|Gary|[EN]If you took the sum of the squares of the positive inputs, offset it by a threshold and ran it through a sigmoid.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_645.wav|Gary|[EN]So you can have lots of 1x1 filters and a smaller number of 3x3 and a smaller number of 5x5.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_646.wav|Gary|[EN]So these would be, each one of these would be computed across the whole image.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_647.wav|Gary|[EN]And I should say, x doesn't need to be binary.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_648.wav|Gary|[EN]That's basically speech recognition.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_649.wav|Gary|[EN]Like the next year, there's a rumor that somebody on the program committee said, we don't want any deep learning here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_650.wav|Gary|[EN]It could be built in, but we didn't in this case. Rotation, not so good.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_651.wav|Gary|[EN]But now the panda image, now it outputs given.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_652.wav|Gary|[EN]Oh, OK. So you only connect the elephant plane to the elephant output. So the DE will only be the elephant ones. Sorry?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_653.wav|Gary|[EN]So nearby states aren't necessarily going to be the same or as good.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_654.wav|Gary|[EN]So backprop learns this solution through the magic of gradient descent.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_655.wav|Gary|[EN]It's just that we only take inputs from a small part of the world.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_656.wav|Gary|[EN]It didn't have any internal memory of the state.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_657.wav|Gary|[EN]So I was going to talk about the lottery ticket hypothesis next.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_658.wav|Gary|[EN]And it turns out, Almanets could learn that, but it took them 5,000 more epics to learn to remember a single bit.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_659.wav|Gary|[EN]So you mean this one or? Salient span.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_660.wav|Gary|[EN]So what are some of the limitations of state of the art AI?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_661.wav|Gary|[EN]And we saw that, okay.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_662.wav|Gary|[EN]And then you invert the rectified linear function, which you can't really invert when it's 0, but you can when it's greater than 0.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_663.wav|Gary|[EN]These are grades from last time I taught, 150.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_664.wav|Gary|[EN]And that's essentially how GPT-3 and CHAT-GPT and all these large language models learn.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_665.wav|Gary|[EN]And what we're going to talk about now is linear regression.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_666.wav|Gary|[EN]They transcribed, they were linguists, and I guess this is what linguists do for fun.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_667.wav|Gary|[EN]But if you thresholded it at 0.5, it would be right.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_668.wav|Gary|[EN]Yeah, so you got to make sure. Yeah, so people try different things.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_669.wav|Gary|[EN]Sometimes I give that as a extra lecture.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_670.wav|Gary|[EN]So I pulled it out because it's out of scope of the sum now.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_671.wav|Gary|[EN]And look at how it persists much longer than this guy does.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_672.wav|Gary|[EN]So convolution is shift equivariant, as we suspected.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_673.wav|Gary|[EN]And then they progressively trained it on higher and higher resolution.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_674.wav|Gary|[EN]Does it know what that item can be used for?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_675.wav|Gary|[EN]That happened in 1997.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_676.wav|Gary|[EN]So here's an example where TD Gammon changed how the experts play the game.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_677.wav|Gary|[EN]Whereas stochastic gradient descent is an online learning method.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_678.wav|Gary|[EN]So when you're using it, you encode all of the patches.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_679.wav|Gary|[EN]By 2030's virtual reality will begin to feel 100% real.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_680.wav|Gary|[EN]That's just the chain rule. That should look familiar as well.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_681.wav|Gary|[EN]So if we're here on this flat spot, it's going to take a long time to get off the plateau because we don't have much of a gradient. It's near zero.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_682.wav|Gary|[EN]In fact, there's probably more.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_683.wav|Gary|[EN]Again, if we use the teacher, that's called teacher forcing, it learns faster that way.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_684.wav|Gary|[EN]So you have to decide the maximum number of digits in each number.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_685.wav|Gary|[EN]So that slide I showed you before was Q values.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_686.wav|Gary|[EN]And then we define delta as minus the derivative of the gradient with respect to the weighted sum of the inputs.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_687.wav|Gary|[EN]So we have this, and we're back to the delta rule.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_688.wav|Gary|[EN]That's my teacher now for that state action pair.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_689.wav|Gary|[EN]So what is that encoding?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_690.wav|Gary|[EN]There's also, if you count the inputs, there's D of those, D plus one of those.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_691.wav|Gary|[EN]So it's upscaling until it gets to the final output.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_692.wav|Gary|[EN]So again, as I showed at the end, this is the actual model of the whole thing.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_693.wav|Gary|[EN]and then ask for the next input, and then I'm done.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_694.wav|Gary|[EN]So hopefully some of you will have fewer to have more time to talk about them.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_695.wav|Gary|[EN]We increment or decrement or leave it alone.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_696.wav|Gary|[EN]and they're propagated back up the tree using a minimax type thing.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_697.wav|Gary|[EN]It's simple to implement, but it takes a large batch size, so you need a lot of GPUs.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_698.wav|Gary|[EN]So this is called the Model 2.0, because I already had a model that I called the model.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_699.wav|Gary|[EN]He used these little tiny networks, but he was doing exactly what they're doing today.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_700.wav|Gary|[EN]It's fairly invariant to scale.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_701.wav|Gary|[EN]And it's labeling this as food, dinner, barbecue, market, meal, turkey, grill, pizza, eat, holiday.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_702.wav|Gary|[EN]And then it's learning by Q-learning, which is a kind of temporal difference.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_703.wav|Gary|[EN]These are all, oh, here's all the things.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_704.wav|Gary|[EN]We tried VGG, ResNet, et cetera.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_705.wav|Gary|[EN]Barlow twins doesn't seem to care about bat size.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_706.wav|Gary|[EN]And I think the Me Too movement is totally fabulous and I love Time's Up.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_707.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, so let me explain the game to you.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_708.wav|Gary|[EN]What's max how many people already know what maximum likely it is?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_709.wav|Gary|[EN]And so those are my new weights.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_710.wav|Gary|[EN]58 of you voted, 61.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_711.wav|Gary|[EN]Conjugate grading is kind of a one and a half order technique.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_712.wav|Gary|[EN]It's real time, so you're continuously outputting actions.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_713.wav|Gary|[EN]We're gonna get larger and larger.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_714.wav|Gary|[EN]And that's going to have diminishing returns.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_715.wav|Gary|[EN]And I say, I'm planning on only giving Joe 50% of the points.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_716.wav|Gary|[EN]And yeah, and so if you have a softmax output, though, you always have some chance of taking a random action, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_717.wav|Gary|[EN]lighting changes, and scale, and rotation, all those sorts of things.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_718.wav|Gary|[EN]What could be wrong with that?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_719.wav|Gary|[EN]Or you can optimize an input image to maximize a particular feature or class.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_720.wav|Gary|[EN]So bigrams are the statistics of pairs of words in the language.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_721.wav|Gary|[EN]And that's what's being shown in this table is just taking, adding basically a softmax to the first layer.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_722.wav|Gary|[EN]Again, a Gabor is a sine wave restricted by a Gaussian envelope.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_723.wav|Gary|[EN]I assume you all know what z-scoring is.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_724.wav|Gary|[EN]so you can investigate the filters.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_725.wav|Gary|[EN]So it learned essentially this program without being told.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_726.wav|Gary|[EN]now. Again, all of these are connected to just this guy.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_727.wav|Gary|[EN]And now I can train it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_728.wav|Gary|[EN]So if the weights are too small, that gradient is going to shrink exponentially.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_729.wav|Gary|[EN]I'll tell you a little bit more about how it works next time.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_730.wav|Gary|[EN]So early on, these worked well for MNIST.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_731.wav|Gary|[EN]So we send Bob 50% of the time.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_732.wav|Gary|[EN]And you should be able to tell me what this graph is showing.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_733.wav|Gary|[EN]And then the error goes up again for B. You get high I.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_734.wav|Gary|[EN]It's a tremendously big league problem.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_735.wav|Gary|[EN]So it's taking the activation from above that's computed by using the transpose of the weights.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_736.wav|Gary|[EN]So the activity space is two-dimensional, and it has to be linearly separable at that point.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_737.wav|Gary|[EN]Dreyfus's brother said, it's like claiming that the first monkey that climbed a tree was making progress towards landing on the moon.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_738.wav|Gary|[EN]So it's closely related to the value.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_739.wav|Gary|[EN]And there have been some algorithms which used random top-down weights, but they only worked for smallish networks.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_740.wav|Gary|[EN]representation is. So one way to look at this[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_741.wav|Gary|[EN]Which is, you're trying to, this is the original input.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_742.wav|Gary|[EN]that fools the discriminator.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_743.wav|Gary|[EN]I just heard it yesterday, so tell me.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_744.wav|Gary|[EN]that says how far are we going to go in the direction of the gradient.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_745.wav|Gary|[EN]So by preconditioning this to be a language model, it makes it much easier.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_746.wav|Gary|[EN]And then if I have time today, I'll talk about image transformers a bit.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_747.wav|Gary|[EN]but it's much more invariant than it was.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_748.wav|Gary|[EN]So yeah, certainly that would probably work better.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_749.wav|Gary|[EN]And then he says, I'm married. And Chat GPT says, you're unhappy and you're married.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_750.wav|Gary|[EN]Small local receptive fields and learn features correspond to locality.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_751.wav|Gary|[EN]So eventually, you just end up with one uber vector.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_752.wav|Gary|[EN]If x is from real data, we're trying to maximize that. Right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_753.wav|Gary|[EN]We're just trying to learn a set of weights that solves the problem for us.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_754.wav|Gary|[EN]So I've already given you the idea of receptive field.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_755.wav|Gary|[EN]But, you know, so these are all things.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_756.wav|Gary|[EN]Terrorists, dictators, and warlords will have access. And I'll down.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_757.wav|Gary|[EN]But these guys from MIT, of course, figured this out.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_758.wav|Gary|[EN]And you have to do it in a batch way.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_759.wav|Gary|[EN]So again, the left and the right are 0 and 360 degrees.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_760.wav|Gary|[EN]So it's going to feature processing instead of holistic processing.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_761.wav|Gary|[EN]And again, this could be at any layer of the network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_762.wav|Gary|[EN]It's a point in a very, your face is a point in a very high dimensional space.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_763.wav|Gary|[EN]You don't need to remember a bunch of other numbers.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_764.wav|Gary|[EN]Okay, so now that's either a two or three layer network depending on your pronoun.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_765.wav|Gary|[EN]Okay, so what's the derivative of T with respect to W?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_766.wav|Gary|[EN]So how does that do that?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_767.wav|Gary|[EN]It's considered one of the hardest classes in the department.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_768.wav|Gary|[EN]But you're not going to have to prove that for your, it's just the proof.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_769.wav|Gary|[EN]Remember what the weight change rule is. It involves x.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_770.wav|Gary|[EN]So you're going to have one, two, three dimensions of your PCA.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_771.wav|Gary|[EN]that's when you have your retina, your foveas is disrupted.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_772.wav|Gary|[EN]And I just haven't changed all of them over to black and white yet.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_773.wav|Gary|[EN]And if they're bigger, you're in a softmax, so elephant gets suppressed.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_774.wav|Gary|[EN]And the sum of many independent random variables is a Gaussian, it turns out.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_775.wav|Gary|[EN]And maybe this strategy that is going to beat you is not a great strategy in isolation, but it's certainly going to help you become a better player.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_776.wav|Gary|[EN]But in that case, they're not the same network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_777.wav|Gary|[EN]But that, which means every new game has to be learned from scratch.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_778.wav|Gary|[EN]is, again, suppose you're some pixel off the digit in MNIST.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_779.wav|Gary|[EN]And if it's inactive, there's no change.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_780.wav|Gary|[EN]So all the agent has to know is its current state.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_781.wav|Gary|[EN]So that must have been, on average, a good move.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_782.wav|Gary|[EN]So again, use stochastic gradient descent and shuffle your examples.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_783.wav|Gary|[EN]And then they flashed up this picture.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_784.wav|Gary|[EN]And the simplest thing to do is just train that single layer of weight.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_785.wav|Gary|[EN]Because when I say deeper layers, so the gradient doesn't vanish at the output, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_786.wav|Gary|[EN]We'll see what it can learn in a minute, but I don't know.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_787.wav|Gary|[EN]they could be anywhere in the space.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_788.wav|Gary|[EN]So this 400 million image text pairs.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_789.wav|Gary|[EN]the final prediction of Alice's model is given by a sig.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_790.wav|Gary|[EN]Once you've got the dice roll, it's deterministic what the next states can be.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_791.wav|Gary|[EN]We also developed this kind of curriculum training where we trained on a subset of the training.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_792.wav|Gary|[EN]has to pay more attention to shape.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_793.wav|Gary|[EN]And a Jordan net couldn't do that because all it had was its output.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_794.wav|Gary|[EN]And the goal was to move the tiles until they were in order, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Except it only went up to eight.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_795.wav|Gary|[EN]This is an infinite horizon.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_796.wav|Gary|[EN]When do we worry about the 2066 asteroid collision?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_797.wav|Gary|[EN]and the two that it doesn't know well, it actually does it slightly better when they're made bigger, at least at first.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_798.wav|Gary|[EN]we do local pooling and that gives the input to the next layer up.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_799.wav|Gary|[EN]So there are three things contributing to the deltas here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_800.wav|Gary|[EN]And the reason that's OK is because the relationship units take care of the gender.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_801.wav|Gary|[EN]Gradient descent with momentum is guaranteed to converge to the global minimum.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_802.wav|Gary|[EN]And look at this is training iterations from left to right.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_803.wav|Gary|[EN]and that helps me know if you're following along.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_804.wav|Gary|[EN]Zealer Fergus. This is Rob Fergus's tutorial. I should remember that.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_805.wav|Gary|[EN]So boy and girl may be very close together.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_806.wav|Gary|[EN]And then, OK, how about this clicker question?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_807.wav|Gary|[EN]So that's the main idea of a lot of self-supervised approaches.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_808.wav|Gary|[EN]And Google Glass built things into glasses, and he's predicted that as well.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_809.wav|Gary|[EN]Now, I know there's been a lot of layoffs in the tech industry, so you're in the right place.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_810.wav|Gary|[EN]Each neuron should satisfy invariance.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_811.wav|Gary|[EN]Otherwise I'll go on to the next lecture.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_812.wav|Gary|[EN]then it wouldn't learn any good representations.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_813.wav|Gary|[EN]and the activations are no longer in the right place. But the activations were put there particularly to drive a particular output in a targeted attack.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_814.wav|Gary|[EN]Okay, so this is, and then this is the final representation.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_815.wav|Gary|[EN]The first layer has this attention filter plus a feedforward network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_816.wav|Gary|[EN]And so this is a model-free method for training, because you don't have any idea.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_817.wav|Gary|[EN]except that we have to incorporate this constraint that the weights are tied to each other.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_818.wav|Gary|[EN]And so it's sharing features, it's learning features from two heads.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_819.wav|Gary|[EN]you at least have to add the last layer of weights going to the new softmax or whatever it is you're trying to do.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_820.wav|Gary|[EN]He was trying to say that this is a bad thing and we should worry about it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_821.wav|Gary|[EN]There's a separate latent seed.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_822.wav|Gary|[EN]And then you can say they're the same, because you know they're the same.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_823.wav|Gary|[EN]And again, the important thing in maximum likelihood is how you model the probability distribution of the data.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_824.wav|Gary|[EN]So the weights, so this is an assumption.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_825.wav|Gary|[EN]And when you do that, you feed back error.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_826.wav|Gary|[EN]And you can do that for any game.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_827.wav|Gary|[EN]Other combinations of these units will pick out other parts of the tree.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_828.wav|Gary|[EN]So I'm going to let you go and finish this next week. So tomorrow night is the review for the final.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_829.wav|Gary|[EN]And then the output would be a probability distribution over moves based on the board.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_830.wav|Gary|[EN]So they have trouble dealing with long-range dependencies. And LSTMs have solved this. OK.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_831.wav|Gary|[EN]I take the next two closest ones, average them together.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_832.wav|Gary|[EN]if the keep gate is on. And then you can read out later if the read gate is on.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_833.wav|Gary|[EN]Up and down is which way the R is going.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_834.wav|Gary|[EN]This is another way of taking text and using it to classify images.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_835.wav|Gary|[EN]But pretty interesting.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_836.wav|Gary|[EN]And then the actual model was very complicated.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_837.wav|Gary|[EN]He was a physics PhD student.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_838.wav|Gary|[EN]So I might give you something like this on a test.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_839.wav|Gary|[EN]So I do report you to the academic integrity office.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_840.wav|Gary|[EN]This is linear probing, meaning you just use the last hidden layer of the network to bolt that bolt on a classifier on top.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_841.wav|Gary|[EN]So negative examples are self-generated by using other characters from the 10.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_842.wav|Gary|[EN]India recently passed laws biased against Muslims.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_843.wav|Gary|[EN]Usually I'm doing small edits, so they're very similar.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_844.wav|Gary|[EN]Skip to clicker question.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_845.wav|Gary|[EN]record what their brain looks like averaged over all those objects.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_846.wav|Gary|[EN]Don't worry, we'll just have human AI teams.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_847.wav|Gary|[EN]And then just writing out what this is, we get the sum over I can't see it from here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_848.wav|Gary|[EN]And the generator wants to minimize it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_849.wav|Gary|[EN]And so conn nets don't make sense for this one.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_850.wav|Gary|[EN]So any questions about this part?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_851.wav|Gary|[EN]It throws away color and shape and things like that.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_852.wav|Gary|[EN]It is a real-time strategy game, which means that you don't take turns, you play and you have to play fast.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_853.wav|Gary|[EN]And then they had six units here and six units here, which had to learn features of those entities that are useful for solving the task.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_854.wav|Gary|[EN]With probability 1 minus epsilon, you take the best action, the greedy action.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_855.wav|Gary|[EN]when you're able to say that's a 2002 BMW Series 7.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_856.wav|Gary|[EN]And you should use gradient descent with momentum.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_857.wav|Gary|[EN]We'd see which ones perform the best, and then kind of mix them through crossover.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_858.wav|Gary|[EN]Oh, you mean starting with 2% of the weights over and over again?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_859.wav|Gary|[EN]And you'll see people talk about lodges.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_860.wav|Gary|[EN]Learning on some patterns ruins learning on others because you're using the same weights to do the, you're changing the weights that are used for all the patterns.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_861.wav|Gary|[EN]So putting all this together, the stable diffusion model takes both the latency and the text prompt as input.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_862.wav|Gary|[EN]And that's what this is.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_863.wav|Gary|[EN]you can have discrete and continuous reinforcement learning. Produces some action at time step t out of a set of possible actions.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_864.wav|Gary|[EN]you would copy the output back.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_865.wav|Gary|[EN]But you wouldn't know reading Shakespeare. You might think it is a word, and you just don't know it.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_866.wav|Gary|[EN]It's not completely, it's not random uniformly at random.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_867.wav|Gary|[EN]Except there must have been some differences in the pixels that you couldn't see because it could still go back to the original Donald Trump picture.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_868.wav|Gary|[EN]So that's this Gaussian is the probability of the target given X zero.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_869.wav|Gary|[EN]They're not quite as good as large over-parameterized networks trained on the same dataset, but they're pretty close.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_870.wav|Gary|[EN]and traffic sign recognition better than humans.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_871.wav|Gary|[EN]Mouinnie found that a facial detection algorithm couldn't find her face.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_872.wav|Gary|[EN]And because it's a quadratic, it's a quadratic.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_873.wav|Gary|[EN]Okay, and you can get all these games online.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_874.wav|Gary|[EN]And again, every point in the space is pretty close to a face.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_875.wav|Gary|[EN]It was much better to do the eight.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_876.wav|Gary|[EN]and beta is one, that operation will produce an address vector that doesn't look very good.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_877.wav|Gary|[EN]It was very nice to include me because we had some discussions.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_878.wav|Gary|[EN]And then what's along the diagonal, is it's percent correct?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_879.wav|Gary|[EN]You guys can see my screen again, right?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_880.wav|Gary|[EN]tuned CNNs with just a few hidden layers get about 0.6% error on MNIST.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_881.wav|Gary|[EN]So this is anger. I don't know if you can read from the back, but that says anger there.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_882.wav|Gary|[EN]They're called residual networks, because all this guy has to learn is the residual, the difference between x and what its output.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_883.wav|Gary|[EN]And then the last week or so, I cover what happened last week in deep learning.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_884.wav|Gary|[EN]And so I should, if this is positive, then I should increase the weight.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_885.wav|Gary|[EN]And these have a name, they're called Gabor filters.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_886.wav|Gary|[EN]No, no, it's OK.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_887.wav|Gary|[EN]If we're doing max pooling here, where we have four numbers and we just pick the maximum.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_888.wav|Gary|[EN]The outputs of sequence of characters.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_889.wav|Gary|[EN]You're continuously emitting actions, not taking turns.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_890.wav|Gary|[EN]So there are really only 79 principal components.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_891.wav|Gary|[EN]This is going to be very similar to what happened with some of the weighted sum of the inputs versus the input, except this time.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_892.wav|Gary|[EN]So the first thing he does is he propagates activity all the way through the network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_893.wav|Gary|[EN]And then we could have, say, in this case, five different features.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_894.wav|Gary|[EN]It's called a rollout because you're rolling dice.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_895.wav|Gary|[EN]And they work the same way, using the same architecture as language transformers, with no convolutions at all.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_896.wav|Gary|[EN]And the most expensive but best way to do it is leave one out, cross-validation, which we used to use when we had small data sets.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_897.wav|Gary|[EN]You're learning by trial and error. You're just trying stuff and seeing what works.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_898.wav|Gary|[EN]You have to just decide to stop at some point.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_899.wav|Gary|[EN]And again, this is just assuming a deep linear network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_900.wav|Gary|[EN]The best way is to get more data or manufacture more data.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_901.wav|Gary|[EN]So we did this, and then we put them in a race to see who wins.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_902.wav|Gary|[EN]But normally, if you're using batch norm, the input on that line is pretty similar.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_903.wav|Gary|[EN]Okay, and I can randomize them so they're not correlated with each other.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_904.wav|Gary|[EN]a little peer instruction here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_905.wav|Gary|[EN]And we trained it to do this program.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_906.wav|Gary|[EN]But anyway, if you know the value of a state and you have a model, then you know.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_907.wav|Gary|[EN]you'll have as many weights as you have pixels.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_908.wav|Gary|[EN]If you're only doing pairs of things, that pair gives the best results.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_909.wav|Gary|[EN]So mapping time into the state of the network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_910.wav|Gary|[EN]I think you all would agree that we'll have AIs that are smarter than us in 10,000 years.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_911.wav|Gary|[EN]and meg-responses of humans listening to sentences or reading sentences.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_912.wav|Gary|[EN]This is somebody in the middle of the network, say. So we don't know what y ought to be.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_913.wav|Gary|[EN]This is your motor control.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_914.wav|Gary|[EN]because if the sine doesn't get it, the cosine will. Right? So it's convolutional.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_915.wav|Gary|[EN]with logistic or softmax outputs, all it can generate is one thing, the expected value of the output given the input.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_916.wav|Gary|[EN]kind of XOR solution.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_917.wav|Gary|[EN]And what that means is you give it a set of inputs, positive and negative.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_918.wav|Gary|[EN]And so now I'm going to go through the derivation of backprop.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_919.wav|Gary|[EN]And then they tried to find an efficient training method for mapping between the image and the text.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_920.wav|Gary|[EN]So if the output is one and it should be zero, lower weights to active inputs.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_921.wav|Gary|[EN]I'm giving it a word at every time step.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_922.wav|Gary|[EN]So there's standard way to do pooling is to do max pooling.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_923.wav|Gary|[EN]And this is how it was actually implemented.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_924.wav|Gary|[EN]If you do just two convolutions, you're basically doing a kind of linear combination of things.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_925.wav|Gary|[EN]And that maybe says something about burgers. I don't know.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_926.wav|Gary|[EN]Mayrab who did some of these slides.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_927.wav|Gary|[EN]But I am. That's a neural network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_928.wav|Gary|[EN]And then it's too late for this guy to fix it, because he doesn't see the output of that.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_929.wav|Gary|[EN]And you get a reinforcement signal that says, was that good or bad?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_930.wav|Gary|[EN]Convergence with a multilayer nonlinear network indicates the network has found a local minima along the error surface.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_931.wav|Gary|[EN]And sorry for you folks at home.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_932.wav|Gary|[EN]And this, you know, so sweat equity.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_933.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, so that's Inception.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_934.wav|Gary|[EN]They want to find another.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_935.wav|Gary|[EN]So you're essentially becoming a word expert, as it were.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_936.wav|Gary|[EN]So that's for all histories.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_937.wav|Gary|[EN]And if you have a thousand categories, you're gonna have a thousand of these.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_938.wav|Gary|[EN]So you want, again, you want g here to be as binary as possible, so it's a logistic output.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_939.wav|Gary|[EN]Adaptive weight changes are only going to deal with these axes, because they're changing the learning rate for a weight.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_940.wav|Gary|[EN]And so you would not really expect it to do very well on these.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_941.wav|Gary|[EN]So you just divide by the number of occurrences of the, and you get a probability distribution over the next word.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_942.wav|Gary|[EN]z-scoring on the other hand shifts the mean of the inputs of the variables to zero[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_943.wav|Gary|[EN]So now they know your name, they know who you're friends with.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_944.wav|Gary|[EN]All right, so last time we derived backprop. Just a quick zip through.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_945.wav|Gary|[EN]And we're going to use small local receptive fields like Jan is using here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_946.wav|Gary|[EN]And that makes it hard to choose a single global learning rate.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_947.wav|Gary|[EN]And then two layers of hidden units before the output.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_948.wav|Gary|[EN]For if this was theta, we'd have 1, 1, 1.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_949.wav|Gary|[EN]It had one binary input, a numeric input, and a binary input.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_950.wav|Gary|[EN]Success in the real world is a little more complicated.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_951.wav|Gary|[EN]And the goal is to develop a network that learns the distribution of the training data.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_952.wav|Gary|[EN]So there's only two directions the weight can.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_953.wav|Gary|[EN]It's going to be in Pepper Canyon Hall.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_954.wav|Gary|[EN]So it's only making about four and a half moves per second.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_955.wav|Gary|[EN]That is, they could gate input from the previous, from the encoder network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_956.wav|Gary|[EN]It's one set of numbers going into here and getting an activation out.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_957.wav|Gary|[EN]They propagated the deltas and then they changed the weights here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_958.wav|Gary|[EN]It's not good for you because it means you didn't learn the material.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_959.wav|Gary|[EN]You start with one layer above the input.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_960.wav|Gary|[EN]You're just combining lots of deltas.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_961.wav|Gary|[EN]Yes, you have said that. Commander, you have devoted your life to the study of cybernetics in general.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_962.wav|Gary|[EN]And most people nowadays use something like Atom as their optimizer.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_963.wav|Gary|[EN]I think I have a few more short answer, a few more multiple answer.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_964.wav|Gary|[EN]So I'm going to make sure you know exactly how it works by making you program it yourself.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_965.wav|Gary|[EN]uh... so yet so we're already done a little playing[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_966.wav|Gary|[EN]Jeff suggested this in the Forward-Forward paper. He said it's simple and it works fast.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_967.wav|Gary|[EN]But if I as an input it's still Z.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_968.wav|Gary|[EN]Remember that backprop is a linear operation.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_969.wav|Gary|[EN]Because maybe I had a 0.6 output. I sampled it. I got a 1. That's going to make that 0.6 go up.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_970.wav|Gary|[EN]If you have none come out, it's not a surprise.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_971.wav|Gary|[EN]And these things are called points.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_972.wav|Gary|[EN]because the mean of this weighted sum.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_973.wav|Gary|[EN]Let's make some big in this.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_974.wav|Gary|[EN]And some of the other large data sets have noisy labels like their JPEG name or the camera settings.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_975.wav|Gary|[EN]neuron activities are sharpened by attention.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_976.wav|Gary|[EN]And then we wrote down the likelihood.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_977.wav|Gary|[EN]And this other guy only connected to the cat output.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_978.wav|Gary|[EN]Last quarter or two quarters ago.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_979.wav|Gary|[EN]And what curiosity means is that what an agent is looking for is things it's never seen before.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_980.wav|Gary|[EN]And with blurring though, first we do that and then we take the max.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_981.wav|Gary|[EN]You know, that surprised me because I like to think about how the brain works and we don't generate new brain.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_982.wav|Gary|[EN]they want you to clean your hair twice for some reason. I think so you use twice as much shampoo and buy more.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_983.wav|Gary|[EN]They're useful for all sorts of things. Our features are useful for all sorts of environments.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_984.wav|Gary|[EN]So you train this on all of Shakespeare, and you get something that's about as understandable as Shakespeare.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_985.wav|Gary|[EN]You give that to the network. You change the weights for that one.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_986.wav|Gary|[EN]So it's obviously a stochastic game.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_987.wav|Gary|[EN]Who's heard of the Markov property before?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_988.wav|Gary|[EN]OK, so the tricky part here.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_989.wav|Gary|[EN]But there were numbers on the tiles in an empty space.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_990.wav|Gary|[EN]They know a lot more about computer vision than I do.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_991.wav|Gary|[EN]They had two kids, Arthur and Victoria. Andrew and Christine had James.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_992.wav|Gary|[EN]So there's local consistency.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_993.wav|Gary|[EN]So it's the cosine between the key vector and every different memory vector.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_994.wav|Gary|[EN]because he was the first science fiction author.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_995.wav|Gary|[EN]So there's this other model you train to go from the clip text embedding to the image encoding.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_996.wav|Gary|[EN]And if you've got big memory and big iron, you can do that.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_997.wav|Gary|[EN]How many people have had any reinforcement learning?[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_998.wav|Gary|[EN]So but I highly recommend Andrej Karpathy's blog for how to train a neural network.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_999.wav|Gary|[EN]It's very socially difficult.[EN]
./custom_character_voice/Gary/processed_1000.wav|Gary|[EN]Yeah, so the gradient starts at the output. You're applying a linear operation over and over again.[EN]
